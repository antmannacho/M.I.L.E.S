## üåê **Core Features**
- üì° **Powered by AI language models:** Operated by **`GPT-4-Turbo`** model out of the box, but easily switchable to **`any other OpenAI model`** via asking Miles to change it.
- üéµ **Integrated with Spotify:** Enjoy `seamless Spotify controls` right from your voice. *(Requires Spotify Premium)*
- ‚òÄÔ∏è **Weather Capabilities:** Stay updated with `real-time weather data`.
- üß† **Persistant Selective Memory:** Ask Miles to `remember something, ask him to forget it`.
- üßÆ **Calculator:** Don't rely on language model math, Miles can use a `real calculator`.
- üß© **Multi-tasker:** Miles can use up to `3 tools at the same time`.
- ü§î **Context:** `Miles has context` about him, who made him, the app he's in, and who you are through things you ask him to remember.
- üéôÔ∏è **Realistic Voice:** Miles `doesn't sound like a robot, he sounds real`. (Both faster and cheaper than eleven labs for the same quality - OpenAI TTS)
- üîä **Wake word:** Our wake word detection is `on par with smart home assistants`.

## üî• **Tips and Tricks**
- ‚ÄºÔ∏è **I strongly recommend you `ask Miles what he can do and what tools he can use`, he is aware of everything he can do when using the `default system prompt`.**
- üí∞ **Find it too expensive to run?** Just `ask Miles to be cheaper` and he will switch his language model and ask him to make his system prompt cheaper and he will be more cost effective for you.
- ü™™ **Ask Miles to be Anything** Miles can `manipulate his own personality and instructions`, just ask him to be anything and he will rewrite himself to comply.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Things to Note**: When you ask Miles to be cheaper, he will do both of these things:
  1. Switch his model to `GPT-3.5-Turbo`.
  2. Rewrite his system prompt to `reduce the token count by 700 tokens`.
  3. However, in doing both of these things, he will lose most of his functinality and will be less helpful, he `does NOT actually lose any functinality` in doing this, but he may hallucinate that he can't do some of the things you ask him to do. Asking him to write a custom system prompt for a specific list of instructions will help.

üí° **Note:** Before diving in, make sure you have your **`OpenAI API key`**. Place this key within the quotes in the `apikey.py` file.

## üìÑ **What commands are there?**
`There are no commands`, Miles is powered by a language model, not code, say anything however you like and it will work, want to play Spotify? You can just say this:
- `"Miles, prithee, lend thine ear to Spotify's sweet melodies and grace us with a song that doth stir the soul."`
  ### or this:
- `"Miles, play that one song that was in the spongebob movie."`
  ### or this:
- `"Miles, in yonder digital realm of Spotify, embark thou upon a quest to unleash the timeless lay 'Never Gonna Give You Up', that we may be ensnared in its melodious rapture most unexpected."`

  <br><br>
  ## üîç M.I.L.E.S Action notifications
  If they look wonky it's because each action has an animation and it's hard to screenshot because it's moving + Miles responds too fast to screenshot it. Sorry about that!
  ![M.I.L.E.S Actions](https://github.com/small-cactus/M.I.L.E.S/blob/main/screenshots/actions.webp)
  - These action notifications are outdated as of today, there are 10 new actions Miles can perform on top of the ones shown, I will update them when I have time.

<br><br>

## üîç **Troubleshooting**
**This is a beta release, troubleshooting steps are based off of nothing but `hopes and dreams` of what I think might go wrong, submit issues in `githubs issue tracker` for now if the steps don't help.**
### **It won't start**
1. Check if you have access to the model this project uses, if you don't, follow the instructions in `OpenAI section` above.
2. Check if you have `python 3.11`, open terminal and run `brew search python`. Check for a `green checkmark` next to `python 3.11`, if there isn't, refer to `inital setup instructions`.

### **Nothing works and I'm going crazy!!!**
1. `Calm down`
2. Using the `same commands` in the inital setup, replace `install` with `uninstall` and click enter.
3. Now we're going to make a `virtual environment`, this seperates my project from anything on your Mac that might be conflicting with it, don't worry, this is easy.
4. **First,** `make a new folder anywhere`, name it anything you want, but let's call it `virtual-env`.
5. **Next,** `right click the folder and click open in terminal`, next enter the following command `python3.11 -m venv myenv`.
6. **Next,** now that we have the environment created, we need to activate it, **run the command** `source myenv/bin/activate`.
7. **Lastly,** if you can see the little (myenv) on the left of the command line, you did it right! if not, delete the folder and try again.
8. **What next?** Now that you have the virtual environment set up, just go through the setup as normal like it's written above. Just make sure you use the `cd` command followed by a file or folder directory instead of opening the terminal directly from the file. Good luck!

### **All hope is lost, I am so lost.**
1. No worries!
2. Log into `ChatGPT`.
3. Paste the entirety of this text into `ChatGPT`. You may need to do small portions and go 1 at a time.
4. Ask ChatGPT "`How do I install this? I'm so confused!`"
5. Hope and pray that it understands.
6. Good luck.

### **All I ask for is mercy, these funny magic words are nonsense, what even is a command????????**
1. **Beginner's Quest:** Google "`Free online coding courses for beginners`" and pick one.
2. **Three-Month Challenge:** Spend the next three months learning the basics of coding.
3. **Immerse Yourself:** Surround your workspace with coding notes and `inspirational quotes`.
4. **YouTube Marathon:** Watch as many coding tutorials as you can until you dream in code.
5. **Community Engagement:** Join online coding forums and share your journey.
6. **The Return:** Armed with knowledge, revisit this project and conquer the commands.
7. **Wisdom of the Ages:** If stuck, seek advice from the `oldest tech wizard` you know.
8. **Celebrate Your Triumph:** Regardless of the outcome, treat yourself for embarking on this coding adventure.





## ‚ú® **Highlights & Features**
- **Unrestricted Interaction**: M.I.L.E.S has `no token limit`, this means you might be twiddling your thumbs if you submit a long request.
  
- **Intuitive Understanding & Action**: Powered by an advanced `language model`, M.I.L.E.S not only grasps even the most uniquely phrased commands but also proactively executes actions when it deems necessary. It's basically `magic in a bottle`, but not it a bottle, or magic.
  
- **Customization**: Just `ask M.I.L.E.S to change his model` and he will. Miles can also `change his own system prompt on command` or by himself to whatever he wants.
  
- **World Class Wake Word Invocation**: Whether you say `"Hey Miles"`, `"Hi Miles"`, `"What's up Miles"`, `"Miles"`, or literaly any starting phrase that ends with `"Miles"`, the system WILL respond accurately. We have about a `10% fail rate` for hearing if it's been activated, and a 0% accidental activation error rate.
  
- **Advanced Audio Processing**: M.I.L.E.S excels in noisy environments, ensuring accurate command interpretation.
  
- **Graphics & Interface**: Features a `dynamic interface` displaying Spotify song playback, weather cards, user interactions, and ongoing actions.

## üìú **Changelog**
- üîä **Realistic Voice Upgrade with `OpenAI TTS`**: M.I.L.E.S now utilizes `OpenAI TTS` for Text-To-Speech, elevating the voice quality to `ultra-realistic` levels. M.I.L.E.S will seamlessly switch to a `basic TTS` if any errors are detected.
- üì¢ **Enhanced Wake Word Detection**: M.I.L.E.S now leverages the same technology used in `leading smart home products` like `Google Home` and `Alexa` for `unmatched wake word detection accuracy`, this means you don't have to wait for the program to listen and stop listening, now it's `always listening`!
- üî¢ **Enhanced Calculator Operations**: M.I.L.E.S now efficiently handles `multiple simultaneous calculations` at the same time.
- üí° **Improved UI**: Introducing a `graphical interface` for better user interactions.
- üå¶Ô∏è **Enhancements**: Augmented `weather data`, `permanent memory`, and `date + time support`.
- üé≤ **Multi-Task Mode** M.I.L.E.S can use up to `3 tools` at once, this means M.I.L.E.S can find the weather in `Shanghai`, calculate the temp difference if it were to drop `23.883 degrees`, and then store it in memory to call upon later, all before he even responds to you. That's the future.
- üíª **Cross Platform!** M.I.L.E.S now supports `MacOS` and `Windows 10/11`.
- üéß **Full Playback Controls** M.I.L.E.S can now `pause`, `unpause`, `toggle playback`, set `spotify volume`, and set `system volume`.
- üîá **Smart Audio Management** If you request Miles while a song is playing, he will `pause it to listen`, `unpause at a low volume` while he speaks, and return to the `orginal volume` when he's done talking. Miles also remembers `playback states` and `volume levels`.
- üíæ **Internal Automatic Model Switching** Find that `GPT-4-Turbo` is too expensive? Just ask Miles to change it to the `cheaper one`. It's that simple.
- üåò **Dynamic Action Notifications** Miles' UI now shows `what specifically he is doing`, instead of "Searching a song" it'll now say "Searching for `Never gonna give you up`". This is applied for all Actions.
- ü™™ **Internal Automatic Personality switching** M.I.L.E.S can now change his own `system prompt` from what you ask, or by himself. This lets him or you specify `personality traits`, `ways of responding`, and `topics to talk about or avoid`. Think of it like a `instruction set` combined with a `personality desctiption`.



## üÜï **In Progess Features**
- üò≠ **Graphical API key interface** Starting idk when you'll be able to start Miles instantly after install and it will prompt you to insert API keys, once you insert the API keys, cient secrets etc and click the submit button, it will close the input screen and allow you to talk to Miles without ever having to open a seperate file.
- **Progress on feature:** 1% complete, I had it working fine, tried to over achieve and make it test each API key, realied I suck at reading and writing JS, scraped all of the JS, went back to working copy of Miles and now I'm left with JUST the raw HTML and CSS elements with no logic behind it. Good idea scrapping it? Yes, I had 15 functions written across 3 files that all talk to each other for no reason and never even worked, I started coding at 6pm, and ended at 5am, with no working code, nothing worked, no errors, all console log prints never even worked.

- ‚öôÔ∏è **Graphical settings and config menu** As much as I want the users of Miles to speak their every command and desire to him without ever clicking buttons or typing, I also don't want people to have to physically change lines of code to get Miles to work. Let's say someone doesn't have access to GPT-4-Turbo, most people don't, since you wouldn't be able to ask Miles to switch the model by himself, you'd have to dig into the main code, so instead, right after I get the api key interface working, i'll be putting both the api key interface, and any config settings including speed and cost optimizing features in a settings menu that will be located in the top right of the app.

## üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è **About Me**

Hello! I'm a one-man developer team, currently navigating the world of high school. Balancing between academics and passion projects means it might take me a few months to roll out new features for M.I.L.E.S, but I'm always dedicated to delivering the best.

üîç **My Work Ethic**: At the core of my development philosophy is simplicity and accessibility. I firmly believe that everyone, irrespective of their expertise or financial standing‚Äîbe it novice or advanced, rich or poor‚Äîshould have access to cutting-edge technology like M.I.L.E.S. It's for this reason I've committed to keeping M.I.L.E.S free, permanently. Despite the costs I bear to keep this vision alive. I strive to create an interface so intuitive that anyone can harness its full potential with ease, making AI-driven assistance universally accessible.

üå± **The Origin**: My journey into this world of voice assistants began when I recognized the limitations of platforms like Siri. Eager to bring a more competent solution to the table, I embarked on a self-taught coding expedition. This led to the birth of my initial project, **JarvisChatGPT**, available in my other repository. While JarvisChatGPT was a step in the right direction, emphasizing simplicity, I knew I had the potential to create something even more advanced. Hence, M.I.L.E.S was conceived, a culmination of weeks of learning, testing, and innovating.

Your support fuels my passion, and I'm excited to continue this journey with all of you!

## ü§ù **Contribute to Development**
