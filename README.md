## 🙋‍♂️ **About Me**

Hello! I'm a one-man developer team, currently navigating the world of high school. Balancing between academics and passion projects means it might take me a few months to roll out new features for M.I.L.E.S, but I'm always dedicated to delivering the best.

🔍 **My Work Ethic**: At the core of my development philosophy is simplicity and accessibility. I firmly believe that everyone, irrespective of their expertise or financial standing—be it novice or advanced, rich or poor—should have access to cutting-edge technology like M.I.L.E.S. It's for this reason I've committed to keeping M.I.L.E.S free, permanently. Despite the costs I bear to keep this vision alive, put simple: "I stomach costs, so you can stomach productivity." I strive to create an interface so intuitive that anyone can harness its full potential with ease, making AI-driven assistance universally accessible.

🌱 **The Origin**: My journey into this world of voice assistants began when I recognized the limitations of platforms like Siri. Eager to bring a more competent solution to the table, I embarked on a self-taught coding expedition. This led to the birth of my initial project, **JarvisChatGPT**, available in my other repository. While JarvisChatGPT was a step in the right direction, emphasizing simplicity, I knew I had the potential to create something even more advanced. Hence, M.I.L.E.S was conceived, a culmination of weeks of learning, testing, and innovating.

Your support fuels my passion, and I'm excited to continue this journey with all of you!
