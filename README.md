  ## üîç M.I.L.E.S Action notifications
  If they look wonky it's because each action has an animation and it's hard to screenshot because it's moving + Miles responds too fast to screenshot it. Sorry about that!

- **Customization**: Modify system prompts and wake word within the `main.py` file. (Shhh don't tell anyone but... Miles is soon gonna be able to update his own system prompt if he finds that it limits him in helping you, don't worry, it reverts back to anything you had it set to after miles is finished with it! And yes you can turn this feature off.)

## üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è **About Me**

Hello! I'm a one-man developer team, currently navigating the world of high school. Balancing between academics and passion projects means it might take me a few months to roll out new features for M.I.L.E.S, but I'm always dedicated to delivering the best.

üîç **My Work Ethic**: At the core of my development philosophy is simplicity and accessibility. I firmly believe that everyone, irrespective of their expertise or financial standing‚Äîbe it novice or advanced, rich or poor‚Äîshould have access to cutting-edge technology like M.I.L.E.S. It's for this reason I've committed to keeping M.I.L.E.S free, permanently. Despite the costs I bear to keep this vision alive, put simple: "I stomach costs, so you can stomach productivity." I strive to create an interface so intuitive that anyone can harness its full potential with ease, making AI-driven assistance universally accessible.

üå± **The Origin**: My journey into this world of voice assistants began when I recognized the limitations of platforms like Siri. Eager to bring a more competent solution to the table, I embarked on a self-taught coding expedition. This led to the birth of my initial project, **JarvisChatGPT**, available in my other repository. While JarvisChatGPT was a step in the right direction, emphasizing simplicity, I knew I had the potential to create something even more advanced. Hence, M.I.L.E.S was conceived, a culmination of weeks of learning, testing, and innovating.

Your support fuels my passion, and I'm excited to continue this journey with all of you!
