# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Security is a key priority in my project. This section outlines the versions of my project that are currently being supported with security updates. As the project evolves, more versions may be supported.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |

Please note that only the latest minor version of 1.0.x is actively maintained and supported with security updates. It is highly recommended to always use the latest version.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

I take the security of my project seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, I encourage you to report it to me as soon as possible. I appreciate your efforts in making my project more secure.

Hereâ€™s how you can report a vulnerability:

1. **Contact**: Please use the github security issue reporter to submit issue reports.
   
2. **Acknowledgement**: I aim to acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours.

3. **Communication**: After acknowledgment, I will investigate the issue. I will keep you informed about my progress throughout the process. I may contact you for additional information if needed.

4. **Disclosure**: Once the issue is resolved, I may publish a security advisory, giving credit to the reporter if they wish.

5. **Confidentiality**: Please keep the issue confidential until I have addressed it. Public disclosure of the vulnerability without prior agreement with us may lead to the withdrawal of my support with you.

We are committed to working with the community to verify and respond to any potential vulnerabilities reported to us. Thank you for supporting the security of my project.
