# Contributing to M.I.L.E.S

Thank you for your interest in contributing to M.I.L.E.S. While this project is primarily managed and developed by a small team (or individual), we understand and appreciate the value that community contributions can bring. However, there are some important guidelines and considerations we'd like you to be aware of.

## Please Read Before Contributing

1. **Limited Capacity for Management**: As the primary maintainer(s) of this project, we have limited capacity to manage external contributions. This means that while your contributions are welcome, there might be significant delays in reviewing them.

2. **Contributions are Welcome But Not Actively Sought**: You are welcome to submit pull requests, bug reports, and feature suggestions. However, please understand that active solicitation for contributions is not a priority for this project at the moment.

3. **Quality Standards**: All contributions should meet the existing quality and coding standards of the project. This includes proper documentation, adherence to existing coding styles, and thorough testing.

4. **Communication**: If you choose to contribute, please do so with the understanding that response times might be longer than usual. Patience and clear, respectful communication are greatly appreciated.

5. **Decision Making**: Ultimately, the decision to include contributions rests with the project's maintainer(s). Submission of contributions does not guarantee inclusion in the project.

## How to Contribute

If you decide to contribute, here's how you can do it:

1. **Fork the Repository**: Make a fork of the repository and make your changes there.

2. **Create a Pull Request**: Once you're satisfied with your changes, create a pull request against the main branch of the repository.

3. **Describe Your Changes**: In your pull request, clearly describe what changes you've made and why you believe they are beneficial to the project.

4. **Wait for Review**: Wait for the maintainer(s) to review your contribution. This process may take some time, so your patience is appreciated.

Thank you for understanding the unique nature of this project's management and for considering contributing to M.I.L.E.S.
